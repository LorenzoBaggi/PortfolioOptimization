# PortfolioOptimization

Welcome to the PortfolioOptimization wiki!

Hi! 
I developed a Python where you can compute:

Sharpe Ratio of your favourite portfolio
Calculate the assets allocations to have both max. Sharpe and min. volatility 
Calculate the value at risk of the portfolio 
Calculate che correlation of your securities

I'm always looking for someone that could help me in better organize this script
